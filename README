INSTALLATION

You'll need to install npm to compile everything with grunt

First we need to install the grunt-cli package. This requires admin priviledges:
npm install -g grunt-cli 

The navigate to the project directory and run:
npm install
grunt

You can then run "grunt watch" to keep the project files up to date while editing.
